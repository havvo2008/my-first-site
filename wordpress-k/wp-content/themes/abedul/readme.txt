== Description ==
Abedul is my second WordPress theme, written with publications in mind and love for simple code. It was designed to be fully responsive by taking the mobile-first approach. It features the full range of post formats, three menu locations, four page templates, one sidebar widget area, two footer widget areas and two custom widgets for inserting content in the widget areas.

* Mobile-first, Responsive Layout
* Custom Header
* Social Links
* Post Formats
* The GPL v2.0 or later license. :) Use it to make something cool.
